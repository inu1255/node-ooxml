Numbering in OOXML wordprocessing is implemented by first defining a set of rules for how a particular number scheme is to work.  For example, a traditional outline format might look something like this:I. This is the first levelA. This is the second level1. This is the third level.These set of rules which will be used in the document is defined using the <w:abstractNum> element within the root numbering element of the numbering part (numbering.xml).  This set of definitions is \"abstract,\" however, and is not directly referenced in the document.  Instead, instances of the abstract numbering definition are created using <w:num> elements, also within the numbering part.  Those instances may follow the abstract definition exactly or may define overrides or exceptions to the abstract definition.  Finally, those instances are referenced in the document content.  Below is an abstract numbering definition, followed by an instance of that definition.  Both appear within the numbering part.The above XML defines a leveling scheme with just one level (w:lvl w:ilvl=\"0\").  It also creates an instance numbered 1 (w:num w:NumId=\"1\") referencing the abstractNum without any changes or exceptions.  Within the document content this instance may be referenced for a given paragraph, such as shown in the example below.Note that the numbering reference within the document content in the sample above contains a direct reference to the level to be applied because the <w:numPr> contains both the reference to the numbering definition (numId) and a reference to the level (ilvl). \n    See Paragraph Properties for more on <w:numPr>. The other possible way to reference a level in content is through the referenced paragraph style.  That is, in the <w:abstractNum> the appropriate subsidiary level (lvl) could contain a pStyle with a value of ListParagraph.  In that case, the content contains only a reference to the numbering definition instance (numId), but it also references the paragraph style.  The same style will be found in the numbering definition referenced and that level will be used for the paragraph.The Numbering Definitions part has a root element <w:numbering>.
